            Hi there! I'm a <strong>Product Designer</strong> living in{" "}
            <strong>Berlin</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            From an early age, I was fascinated about human behavior and
            psychologyÂ in problem solving - I was endlessly curious about how
            things work and how they can be improved.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a video maker turned Product Designer, my creative storytelling
            skills and problem-solving ability has been a strong asset on some
            very diverse teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            I entered the audiovisual world studying video production and art
            direction in Buenos Aires, where I worked as a video maker for 10
            years, involved in production, film art direction and video editing.

            In the years 2017-2018, I worked as a Content Manager at{" "}

            , Berlin. Working closely with designers and product managers, I
            found a new love for digital design and a fascination for how
            interfaces are designed. That was the moment when I realized that I was
            going to be a Product Designer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am in love with Design. Design in all its forms - and I am always
            looking for ways to learn and become a better designer. I firmly
            believe that good design can help the world for the better and help
            the people who live in it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also love to hear good music, watch high-rated movies, recharge energy
            in nature, yoga, travelling, cultural differences and
            contrasting points of view.
